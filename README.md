# Data Wrangling and Visualization
## Welcome to my repository!
### In this programming assignment, we will leverage Python's powerful libraries, Pandas and Matplotlib, to clean, organize, and visualize data effectively. Through this process, we will enhance our data analysis skills by transforming raw data into meaningful insights and visual representations.

## Overview:

Data wrangling is converting and translating raw data into a more useful format. 
On the other side, visualization converts data into visual surroundings that are easier to comprehend and study.

This assignment covers:

**Data Cleaning and Transformation** - Handling, reshaping, and mergin data to create a more desireable output.
**Data Visualization** - Creating graphs and plots to reveal pattern and trends using Matplotlib.


## Getting Started:
To utilize Pandas and Matplotlib, we can write the following code:
```
import pandas as np
```

```
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
```
